# Binary tree traversal

## Concepts

**Traversal**
Process of visiting all of the nodes in a tree.

**Enumeration**
The traversal in which each node is visited only once.

**Pre-order traversal**
Recursively defined node traversal in which a node is visited first before any of its children.

**Post-order traversal**
Recursively defined node traversal in which the children nodes are visited first before the node
itself.

**In-order traversal**
Recursively defined node traversal in which the left node is visited first, then the node itself,
and finally the right node. **Binary search tree (BST)** employs this traversal type to traverse the
nodes in increasing order of value.
